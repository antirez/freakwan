This is a quick hack to have a Serial BTE CLI that works on MacOS without
installing any library, only using core stuff. Just reads from the standard
input and writes to the BTE device, and returns what the BTE device sends.

Sorry about the Objective-C part. The code is terrible as I'm not an
Objective-C programmer. But there is no CoreBluetooth lower-level C API
so I had to find my way among the Objective-C Apple chain-of-calls stuff.

# Usage

Build with `make`. Then connect with your device simply write:

./btecli

Or, if you want to connect with a specific device as you have multiple ones,
specify the name of the device (the nick you configured in FreakWAN, or
if you are using some other BLE UART device, the bluetooth name it has
when you scan for BLE devices):

./btecli mydevice

You don't need to specify the full device name. Just a substring contained in the name is enough.
