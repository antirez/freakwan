# Device-specific MicroPython images

For most devices you can just use a default image distributed by MicroPython. Don't bother getting images for Lilygo devices, just download the image for your ESP32 board (vanilla or S3). Unfortunately, sometimes the default image does not work as expected (for example the T3-S3 has a 4MB flash instead of 8MB, and this create issues with the image MicroPython distributes). In this case, we provide a MicroPython image here.
